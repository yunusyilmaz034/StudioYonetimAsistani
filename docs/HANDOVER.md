# Handover — where this project actually is

**Read this first in a new session.** It is the only document that answers "what is live, what is
half-done, and what is somebody waiting on". Everything else in `docs/` explains the system; this
explains the moment.

Keep it current the way the code is kept current: when the state changes, this changes in the same
commit. A handover document that lags is worse than none, because it is believed.

_Last true as of: **2026-07-30**._

## What this is, in one line

A live, multi-tenant Studio Operating System. One studio uses it for real — **Pilates Fitness by
Işıl**, 120 members — and it is the only system they have: they retired the old one on 2026-07-27.
A day this panel cannot open is a day the business cannot run.

- Panel · `panel.pilatesfitnessbyisil.com` (Firebase App Hosting, `studio-yonetim-prod`, europe-west4)
- Public site · `pilatesfitnessbyisil.com` — separate static site, reads prices from `/api/public/products`
- Studio id · `retro`. Nothing in the code may assume it is the only one.

## Live and working

Reservations, check-in (desk · kiosk · **printed daily QR**), attendance, the credit ledger,
packages incl. hybrids, payments through PAYTR (card, links, wallet), the member portal, the member
mobile app, WhatsApp AI reception, notifications, reports, payroll, and a nightly infrastructure
watchdog (domain expiry, TLS, reachability, renewal dates + a Monday heartbeat).

**Members can buy and renew their own packages** from the app and the portal. A renewal is QUEUED
behind the package it renews so no paid day burns unused; a hybrid queues behind every category it
grants and refuses when they disagree. The studio is notified the moment a self-service sale lands.

## Store state

| | Version | Where |
|---|---|---|
| iOS | 1.0.1 (build 4) | **LIVE on the App Store** — approved 2026-07-29 night, in members' hands. |
| Android | 1.0.1 (build 5) | **in closed test**, running normally. |

**Android's production clock is running: 12 testers, day 3 of 14 (2026-07-29).** If a tester leaves
the test the counter RESETS. Do not remove testers. Publishing new builds does not reset it —
which is why the 1.1.0 pair below can be built when its turn comes without costing a day.

**Next mobile release is 1.1.0**, holding two approved-and-deferred items: PF-42 (swap Cüzdan out of
the tab bar for Üyeliğim) and PF-43 (collapse past reservations, mobile + web). Both are specified
file-by-file in `docs/PRODUCT-FEEDBACK.md`. iOS is now clear of review, so the only remaining
constraint is that they ship together in one build rather than one review turn each.

Submissions are automated: `cd apps/mobile && npx eas-cli submit --platform android --profile
production --latest`. The Play service account key is gitignored at
`apps/mobile/google-play-service-account.json` (`eas-play-submit@studio-yonetim-prod...`); the
`androidpublisher` API is enabled on the project. iOS submits the same way but the App Store version
must still be created and sent for review by hand.

## Waiting on the owner

- **Işıl's Excel** — package migration for the members still to be brought over (74 active members
  hold no package). The import wizard is BUILT and waiting for the file: `/import/wizard` reads
  .xlsx or .csv, maps her columns to ours, proposes who each package belongs to, previews the whole
  thing, and can be undone in one click while nothing has touched it. Its preview step IS the
  dry-run, so the agreed sequence collapses to: upload → look → approve → reconcile.
- Invite the remaining members to the portal (the screen has a "Davet bekliyor" filter and a
  one-tap WhatsApp reminder).

## Waiting on us

- **Hybrid purchase, tested live.** One sale must produce N entitlements correctly through the real
  PAYTR path. The rules are written and unit-tested; the path has never run in production.
- **External uptime monitoring.** The watchdog cannot report its own suspension — if the project is
  suspended over an unpaid bill, every alarm goes quiet, which looks exactly like all-clear. The
  Monday heartbeat covers this partially by making silence the signal.
- **Product roadmap Faz A** (`docs/PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md`) — per-studio WhatsApp number, per-studio
  e-mail sender, one-command studio provisioning. Nothing blocks a second studio until these exist.
  No urgency; a second studio (Novozen) has asked but nothing is agreed.

## Things that will bite you

Read `docs/OWNER-RULES.md` §"Traps" before touching the areas it names. In short:

- **Every deploy breaks whatever tab is already open.** Next.js gives each Server Action a
  content-hashed id baked into the page; a new build changes the ids, and a page loaded before it
  gets `Failed to find Server Action … from an older or newer deployment` on the next save. It looks
  like the feature is broken. It is not — that copy of the panel is stale.
  **So: batch fixes into one push while the studio is open, and tell reception to reload once after.**
  Three pushes in ninety minutes on 2026-07-29 cost reception a member registration she could not
  save and a member an invite she could not activate; both were healthy, both tabs were not.
  Staff forms now name the cause and offer a reload button; the invite page reloads itself
  (`apps/web/src/lib/stale-deployment.ts`). Neither helps a page that was already open — only the
  reload does.
- **"Deploy oldu mu?" sorusunun tek doğru cevabı Cloud Run'ın trafik dağılımıdır.** App Hosting'in
  `builds`/`rollouts` listeleme uçları sıralamasız çağrıldığında eski bir sayfa döndürüyor ve
  2026-07-30'da iki kez "deploy tetiklenmedi" diye yanlış teşhise yol açtı — dağıtım çalışıyordu.
  Komut `docs/RUNBOOK.md`'de. Yanlış bir yeşil, kırmızıdan kötüdür: o gün stüdyo açıkken deploy
  edilmediği sanıldığı için resepsiyona haber verilmedi (OR-17).
- **Core changes need TWO deploys.** Push updates App Hosting; the Cloud Functions need
  `firebase deploy --only functions`. The PAYTR callback that actually runs is the FUNCTION.
- **The emulator does not enforce Firestore indexes.** Ordering changes must be verified in prod.
- **`pnpm check` does not run `next build`.** Some rules only exist there (DEBT-031).
- **Production data is never edited by hand.** A paid-but-not-granted payment is settled through the
  break-glass endpoint on the callback function (`?admin=settle`, token = `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`),
  which runs the same domain path and writes the same events, with the actor recorded as
  `platform_admin/break_glass`.

## Where the rest lives

| | |
|---|---|
| Why the system is shaped this way | `docs/architecture/` (`AD-nn`, 21 invariants) |
| How we work, milestone policy | `docs/architecture/10-development-workflow.md` |
| Standing owner decisions | `docs/OWNER-RULES.md` |
| Deliberate debt + repayment triggers | `docs/DEBT.md` |
| Ideas raised, not yet built | `docs/PRODUCT-FEEDBACK.md` (`PF-nn`) |
| Selling this to a second studio | `docs/PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md` |
| Operational procedures, backups | `docs/RUNBOOK.md` |
| What changed, milestone by milestone | `CHANGELOG.md` |

**And the git log.** Commit messages in this repository are written to explain *why*, not what —
`git log --oneline` is the honest history of every decision, including the ones that turned out
wrong and were reversed.
